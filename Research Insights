- Research shows that students who explore a wide range of careers early are more likely to pursue informed education and job choices.

**Core Idea:** Motivation thrives when autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported.

- **Autonomy:** Students choose their paths, projects, and reflections.
- **Competence:** Modules gradually build confidence (strengths quizzes, skill tasks).
- **Relatedness:** Peer reflections and career stories create emotional connection.

**Impact:** This increases intrinsic motivation and engagement—key for Gen Z learners.
